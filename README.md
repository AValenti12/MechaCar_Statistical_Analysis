- The vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. We can then say the vehicle length and ground clearance do impact the miles per gallon. 
- The p-Value is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than the assumed significance level. (The assumed significance level is 0.05%)This means the slope of our linear model is not zero. We can then in turn, reject our null hypothesis.
- The multiple linear regression will predict 71% of the mpg observations since the R-squared is approximatly 0.71.
